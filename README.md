# bot-kurosaki

A small 1-month project building using Node JS, a Discord music bot that was built with an automated Voice Channel user-following behaviour. You can set the master guild member to the bot and it will follow the member from one Voice Channel to another!

### Key Features
## Automated bot user-following behaviour
This feature allows the bot to follow certain guild members to the Voice Channel. If the following member switches/leaves/joins the voice channel, the bot will follow as well. When the bot is first invited to a server, the bot by default will follow the user who invited the bot. 
The behaviour of the bot is illustrated by the **flow chart** below: <br>
